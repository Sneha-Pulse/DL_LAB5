 Sure, let's dive into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture specified in the provided code. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Convolutional Layers:
1. **Convolutional Layer 1:** 
   - Number of Filters: 32
   - Kernel Size: (3, 3)
   - Input Shape: (64, 64, 3)
   - Padding: 'same'
   - Batch Normalization and ReLU Activation Function
   - Max Pooling: Pool size (2, 2)

2. **Convolutional Layer 2:**
   - Number of Filters: 64
   - Kernel Size: (3, 3)
   - Padding: 'same'
   - Batch Normalization and ReLU Activation Function
   - Max Pooling: Pool size (2, 2)

3. **Convolutional Layer 3:**
   - Number of Filters: 128
   - Kernel Size: (3, 3)
   - Padding: 'same'
   - Batch Normalization and ReLU Activation Function
   - Max Pooling: Pool size (2, 2)

### Fully Connected Layers:
4. **Flattening Layer:** Flattens the input after the convolutional layers to prepare for the fully connected layers.

5. **Fully Connected Layer 1:**
   - Units: 512
   - Batch Normalization and ReLU Activation Function
   - Dropout: 0.5 (to prevent overfitting)

### Output Layer:
6. **Output Layer:**
   - Units: 4 (corresponding to the number of classes)
   - Activation Function: Softmax

This CNN architecture follows a sequential model in TensorFlow's Keras. It consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization for normalization of input to the layers, activation functions to introduce non-linearity, max pooling to downsample the feature maps, a flattening layer to flatten the input for the fully connected layers, a fully connected layer with batch normalization and dropout, and an output layer with softmax activation for multiclass classification.

This architecture is designed to process 64x64 RGB images and performs hierarchical feature learning through the convolutional layers, followed by classification using the fully connected layers and output layer.
